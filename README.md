### How To Read This Diagram
1. Start from the left: a contributor writes or updates contract code in the browser UI.
2. Follow the center: the frontend calls backend API routes for compile, deploy, and invoke actions.
3. End on the right: backend tools compile Rust contracts to WASM and interact with Soroban on Stellar Testnet, then return results to the UI.

### Stack At A Glance
- **Frontend** (`frontend/`): Next.js app router UI, Monaco editor integration, and interactive panels for compile/deploy/invoke flows.
- **Backend** (`backend/`): Express API routes (`/compile`, `/deploy`, `/invoke`) that orchestrate Soroban toolchain commands.
- **Smart Contracts** (`contracts/`): Example Soroban contracts written in Rust, compiled to WASM, and deployed/invoked via backend routes.
- **Toolchain**: Rust + Cargo + Soroban CLI for compilation and network interactions.

### Backend API Examples

Base URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/optimizer`

Create strategy:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/optimizer/strategies \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "x-actor-address: GOPTIMIZERADMIN000000000000000000000000000000000000" \
   -d '{
      "name":"Cross-Protocol Stable Vault",
      "protocol":"Blend + Aquarius",
      "apyBps":1200,
      "feeBps":250,
      "compoundInterval":86400
   }'
```

Deposit:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/optimizer/strategies/1/deposit \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "x-actor-address: GUSERADDRESS" \
   -d '{"amount":5000}'
```

Run deterministic backtest:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/optimizer/backtest \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{
      "depositAmount":10000,
      "days":30,
      "apyBps":1200,
      "feeBps":250,
      "compoundEveryDays":7
   }'
```

### Backtesting Assumptions

- deterministic mocked return series (no external market fetch)
- strategy protocol text is used as metadata only
- fees are applied on compound checkpoints
- output includes projected yield, APY, drawdown, fees, and daily equity series

### Deployment/Configuration

Optional backend environment variables:

- `OPTIMIZER_ADMIN_ADDRESS`
- `OPTIMIZER_EXECUTOR_ADDRESS`

Frontend API override:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:5000/api`)

## Quadratic Voting System

A full-stack quadratic voting implementation built on Soroban.

**Live Testnet Contract ID**: `CDKPQE3TWTBF3BLA2IZSFHLXRCTRCPWHFTGBVH6WWPDAEKT3FEJQVBP4`

### How Quadratic Voting Works

Voters spend **credits** to cast votes. The number of votes received equals `floor(sqrt(credits))`:

| Credits | Votes | Cost per extra vote |
|---------|-------|---------------------|
| 1       | 1     | 1                   |
| 4       | 2     | 3                   |
| 9       | 3     | 5                   |
| 16      | 4     | 7                   |
| 100     | 10    | 19                  |

This makes each additional vote progressively more expensive, preventing whale dominance.

### Architecture

```
contracts/quadratic-voting/   ← Soroban/Rust smart contract
backend/src/routes/quadraticVoting.js    ← REST API routes
backend/src/services/quadraticVotingService.js  ← Business logic + caching
backend/src/docs/quadraticVoting.doc.js  ← OpenAPI documentation
frontend/src/components/QuadraticVotingDashboard.tsx  ← React UI
frontend/src/app/quadratic-voting/page.tsx  ← Next.js page
```

### Smart Contract

**Location:** `contracts/quadratic-voting/`

**Functions:**

| Function | Access | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `initialize(admin, voting_period?, max_credits?)` | Public (once) | Initialize contract |
| `create_proposal(admin, title, description, duration?)` | Admin | Create a proposal |
| `cancel_proposal(admin, proposal_id)` | Admin | Cancel active proposal |
| `whitelist(admin, voter, allow)` | Admin | Add/remove voter |
| `vote(voter, proposal_id, credits, is_for)` | Whitelisted | Cast quadratic vote |
| `finalize(proposal_id)` | Anyone | Finalize after voting ends |
| `pause(admin)` / `unpause(admin)` | Admin | Emergency pause |
| `get_proposal(id)` | Read | Fetch proposal data |
| `credits_to_votes(credits)` | Read | Calculate votes from credits |

**Events emitted:** `init`, `proposed`, `voted`, `finalized`, `cancelled`, `paused`, `unpaused`, `wl`

**Security patterns:**
- Checks-effects-interactions ordering
- Admin-only access control via `require_auth()`
- Emergency pause mechanism
- Per-voter credit limits
- One vote per voter per proposal

### Building the Contract

```bash
cd contracts/quadratic-voting
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Run tests
cargo test
```

### Deploying to Testnet

```bash
# Build WASM
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Deploy
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/quadratic_voting.wasm \
  --source <YOUR_ACCOUNT> \
  --network testnet

# Initialize (replace CONTRACT_ID and ADMIN_ADDRESS)
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source <YOUR_ACCOUNT> \
  --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
  --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --voting_period 604800 \
  --max_credits 100
```

## Price Feed Aggregator

A production-ready on-chain price aggregator that combines multiple data sources into a single tamper-resistant price, essential for synthetic assets, stablecoins, and other DeFi applications.

### How It Works

Multiple reporters submit prices independently. The contract filters stale and inactive sources, removes statistical outliers, and applies the configured aggregation strategy (Median, Weighted Average, or Trimmed Mean) to produce a final price.

### Architecture

```
contracts/price-feed-aggregator/   ← Soroban/Rust smart contract
```

### Smart Contract

**Location:** `contracts/price-feed-aggregator/`

**Functions:**

| Function | Access | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `initialize(admin, asset, decimals?, max_price_age?, outlier_bps?, circuit_breaker_bps?, strategy?)` | Public (once) | Initialize contract |
| `add_source(admin, reporter, description, weight?)` | Admin | Register a price source |
| `remove_source(admin, source_id)` | Admin | Deactivate a source |
| `set_weight(admin, source_id, weight)` | Admin | Update source weight (1–100) |
| `update_price(reporter, source_id, price)` | Reporter | Submit a price update |
| `get_price(source_id)` | Read | Raw price for one source |
| `get_aggregated_price()` | Read | Aggregated price across all valid sources |
| `pause(admin)` / `unpause(admin)` | Admin | Emergency pause |

**Aggregation strategies:** `Median` (default), `WeightedAverage`, `TrimmedMean`

**Security features:**
- Circuit breaker — rejects single-update swings above `circuit_breaker_bps` (default 30%)
- Outlier detection — excludes sources deviating > `outlier_bps` from the median (default 20%)
- Stale price exclusion — ignores prices older than `max_price_age` (default 1 hour)
- Per-source reporter authentication via `require_auth()`
- Emergency pause mechanism

**Events emitted:** `init`, `paused`, `unpaused`, `srcadd`, `srcrm`, `priceupd`

### Building the Contract

```bash
cd contracts/price-feed-aggregator
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Run tests
cargo test
```
