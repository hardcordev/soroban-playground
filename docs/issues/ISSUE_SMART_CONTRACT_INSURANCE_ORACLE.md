## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a production-ready insurance oracle contract that provides reliable, tamper-resistant risk data for Soroban applications. This will enable secure insurance protocols, parametric insurance, and other risk management applications.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Applications like insurance protocols currently lack reliable risk data sources. Without insurance oracles, these applications cannot function reliably or securely. Insurance oracles are essential for production-ready risk management applications.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive insurance oracle implementation with:
- Standard risk data interface compliance
- Multiple data source integration (actuarial databases, weather services, historical claims data)
- Comprehensive security features (data validation, outlier detection, circuit breakers)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, property-based)
- Documentation and examples

### Key Features
- `submitRiskData()`, `getRiskData()`, `getHistoricalClaims()` functions for risk management
- `addDataSource()`, `removeDataSource()`, `setVerificationThreshold()` for source management
- Event emissions (`RiskDataSubmitted`, `RiskDataVerified`, `CircuitBreakerActivated`)
- Security features: data validation, outlier detection, circuit breakers

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/insurance-oracle/`
- Testing: `contracts/insurance-oracle/src/test.rs` with 70+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/insurance-oracle/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using existing third-party implementations**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
2. **Single-source risk data only**: Rejected because MVP requires reliability for insurance applications
3. **Frontend-only insurance UI**: Rejected because insurance oracle logic must be on-chain for security
