title: "[SMART CONTRACT] Implement Oracle Aggregation Contract for Reliable Data Feeds"
labels: enhancement, smart-contract, high-priority
assignees: ''
---

## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a production-ready oracle aggregation contract that provides reliable, tamper-resistant data feeds by combining multiple oracle sources. This will enable secure price feeds, weather data, sports results, and other external information.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Soroban applications currently rely on single-source oracles, creating single points of failure and potential manipulation. Without oracle aggregation, financial applications like synthetic assets and prediction markets cannot achieve true decentralization and security. Oracle aggregation is essential for production-ready DeFi infrastructure.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive oracle aggregation implementation with:
- Standard oracle interface compliance
- Multiple aggregation strategies (median, weighted average, trimmed mean)
- Comprehensive security features (source validation, outlier detection, circuit breakers)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, property-based)
- Documentation and examples

### Key Features
- `updatePrice()`, `getPrice()`, `getAggregatedPrice()` functions for price management
- `addSource()`, `removeSource()`, `setWeight()` for source management
- Event emissions (`PriceUpdated`, `SourceAdded`, `SourceRemoved`)
- Security features: outlier detection, circuit breakers, source validation

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/oracle-aggregation/`
- Testing: `contracts/oracle-aggregation/src/test.rs` with 80+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/oracle-aggregation/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using existing third-party implementations**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
2. **Single-source price feeds only**: Rejected because MVP requires reliability for financial applications
3. **Frontend-only price UI**: Rejected because price aggregation logic must be on-chain for security
