## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a centralized contract registry service that provides discoverability and metadata management for Soroban contracts. This will enable contract discovery, verification, and ecosystem interoperability.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Soroban contracts currently cannot be discovered or registered in a centralized location. Without a contract registry, developers must manually track contract addresses and interfaces, creating maintenance challenges and reducing interoperability. A centralized contract registry is essential for production-ready ecosystems.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive contract registry service with:
- REST API for contract registration and discovery
- Database storage for contract metadata
- Verification and validation capabilities
- Search and filtering functionality
- Integration with existing contract templates

### Key Features
- `POST /registry/contracts`: Register new contract
- `GET /registry/contracts`: List all contracts
- `GET /registry/contracts/{id}`: Get contract details
- `GET /registry/contracts/search`: Search by name, category, functionality
- `POST /registry/contracts/{id}/verify`: Verify contract source code

### Implementation Details
- Location: `backend/src/routes/registry.js`
- Service: `backend/src/services/registryService.js`
- Database: PostgreSQL table `contract_registry`
- Documentation: `backend/src/docs/registry.doc.js`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual contract address tracking only**: Rejected because MVP requires automated discovery
2. **Frontend-only registry UI**: Rejected because backend service is essential for reliability
3. **External registry services**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization
