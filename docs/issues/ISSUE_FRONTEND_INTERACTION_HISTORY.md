## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a comprehensive contract interaction history and transaction explorer that allows developers to view, search, and analyze their contract interactions and transactions. This will significantly improve debugging and monitoring capabilities.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Developers currently have no way to view their contract interaction history or explore transaction details. Without interaction history, developers must manually track interactions and cannot debug issues effectively. A comprehensive interaction history is essential for improving developer productivity and debugging capabilities.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive contract interaction history UI with:
- Interactive timeline view of all interactions
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Detailed transaction exploration
- Status tracking and error analysis
- Export functionality for debugging

### Key Features
- Timeline view showing all contract interactions (deploy, invoke, read)
- Search by contract ID, function name, status, date range
- Filter by interaction type (deploy, invoke, read, event)
- Detailed transaction view with raw data, logs, and execution traces
- Status indicators (success, failure, pending) with error details
- Export to JSON for debugging and analysis

### Implementation Details
- Location: `frontend/src/app/interaction-history/page.tsx`
- Components: `frontend/src/components/InteractionTimeline.tsx`, `TransactionExplorer.tsx`, `InteractionFilter.tsx`
- Integration with backend interaction logging and API routes

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual CLI log checking only**: Rejected because MVP requires improved developer experience
2. **Basic interaction list only**: Rejected because comprehensive exploration requires rich UI
3. **Backend-only interaction API**: Rejected because frontend UI is essential for developer experience
