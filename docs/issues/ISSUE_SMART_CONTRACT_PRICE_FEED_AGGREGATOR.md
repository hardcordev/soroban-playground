title: "[SMART CONTRACT] Implement Price Feed Aggregator Contract for Reliable Asset Pricing"
labels: enhancement, smart-contract, high-priority

## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a production-ready price feed aggregator contract that provides reliable, tamper-resistant asset pricing by combining multiple data sources. This will enable secure synthetic assets, stablecoins, and other financial applications.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Financial applications like synthetic assets currently rely on single-source price feeds, creating single points of failure and potential manipulation. Without price feed aggregators, financial applications cannot achieve the reliability and security required for production deployment. Price feed aggregators are essential for production-ready DeFi infrastructure.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive price feed aggregator implementation with:
- Standard price feed interface compliance
- Multiple aggregation strategies (median, weighted average, trimmed mean)
- Comprehensive security features (source validation, outlier detection, circuit breakers)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, property-based)
- Documentation and examples

### Key Features
- `updatePrice()`, `getPrice()`, `getAggregatedPrice()` functions for price management
- `addSource()`, `removeSource()`, `setWeight()` for source management
- Event emissions (`PriceUpdated`, `SourceAdded`, `SourceRemoved`)
- Security features: outlier detection, circuit breakers, source validation

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/price-feed-aggregator/`
- Testing: `contracts/price-feed-aggregator/src/test.rs` with 80+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/price-feed-aggregator/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using existing third-party implementations**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
2. **Single-source price feeds only**: Rejected because MVP requires reliability for financial applications
3. **Frontend-only price UI**: Rejected because price aggregation logic must be on-chain for security
