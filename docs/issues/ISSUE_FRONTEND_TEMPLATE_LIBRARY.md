## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a comprehensive contract template library UI that allows developers to browse, search, filter, and select from the available Soroban contract templates. This will significantly improve developer onboarding and productivity.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Developers currently need to manually navigate the `contracts/` directory structure to find appropriate contract templates. Without a dedicated template library UI, developers waste time searching for templates and may miss relevant examples. A comprehensive template library is essential for improving developer experience and productivity.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive contract template library UI with:
- Responsive grid-based template browsing
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Template categorization and tagging
- Detailed template previews and documentation
- Favorites and recent templates functionality

### Key Features
- Grid view of all 54+ contract templates with icons and descriptions
- Search by name, category, functionality, or keywords
- Filter by contract type (financial, governance, utility, etc.)
- Template preview showing code snippets and usage examples
- Documentation integration with README content
- Favorites system for commonly used templates

### Implementation Details
- Location: `frontend/src/app/template-library/page.tsx`
- Components: `frontend/src/components/TemplateLibraryGrid.tsx`, `TemplateSearchBar.tsx`, `TemplateCard.tsx`
- Integration with existing contract metadata and README files

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual directory navigation only**: Rejected because MVP requires improved developer experience
2. **Basic list view only**: Rejected because comprehensive browsing requires rich UI
3. **Backend-only template API**: Rejected because frontend UI is essential for developer experience
