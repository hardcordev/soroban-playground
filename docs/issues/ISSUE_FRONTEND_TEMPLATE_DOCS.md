## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement comprehensive documentation integration for the contract template library. This will enable developers to access relevant documentation directly from the template browser.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current template browsing requires developers to navigate to separate README files for documentation. Without documentation integration, developers must switch contexts and lose workflow continuity. Documentation integration is essential for improving developer productivity and reducing context switching.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive documentation integration implementation with:
- Inline documentation previews
- Full documentation view
- Documentation search and navigation
- Version-specific documentation
- Interactive code examples and snippets

### Key Features
- Inline README preview in template cards
- Full documentation view with navigation sidebar
- Search across all template documentation
- Version-specific documentation for different Rust versions
- Interactive code examples with copy-to-clipboard
- Documentation status indicators (complete, partial, missing)

### Implementation Details
- Location: `frontend/src/app/template-library/page.tsx`
- Components: `frontend/src/components/TemplateDocumentation.tsx`, `DocumentationSearchBar.tsx`
- Integration with existing contract README files and metadata

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Separate README navigation only**: Rejected because MVP requires improved developer experience
2. **Basic documentation links only**: Rejected because comprehensive integration requires inline viewing
3. **Backend-only documentation API**: Rejected because frontend UI is essential for developer experience
