## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a set of Soroban-specific storage utility contracts that provide reusable, optimized patterns for common storage operations. These utilities will improve developer productivity and reduce boilerplate code across all contract implementations.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Developers building Soroban contracts currently need to implement common storage patterns (mapping, vector, queue, stack) from scratch for each contract. This leads to inconsistent implementations, increased security risks, and wasted development time. Standardized, audited storage utilities would significantly improve contract quality and developer experience.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive set of storage utility contracts including:
- `StorageMap`: Key-value mapping with efficient lookup and iteration
- `StorageVector`: Dynamic array with push/pop operations
- `StorageQueue`: FIFO queue implementation
- `StorageStack`: LIFO stack implementation
- `StorageSet`: Unique value set with membership testing

### Key Features
- Soroban-optimized storage layouts
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Gas-efficient operations
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation and usage examples

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/storage-utils/`
- Testing: `contracts/storage-utils/src/test.rs` with 150+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/storage-utils/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using standard Rust collections**: Rejected because they don't map efficiently to Soroban storage
2. **Implementing utilities in each contract separately**: Rejected due to code duplication and inconsistency
3. **Using external libraries**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
