## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement property-based testing utilities for Soroban contracts that provide reusable, secure patterns for automated contract verification. These utilities will improve developer productivity and reduce security risks in contract testing.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Developers building Soroban contracts currently need to implement custom property-based tests for each contract. This leads to inconsistent testing practices, increased development time, and potential security gaps. Standardized, audited property-based testing utilities would significantly improve test quality and developer experience.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive set of property-based testing utility contracts including:
- `PropertyTester`: Secure wrapper for property-based contract testing
- `InvariantChecker`: Utility for checking contract invariants during testing
- `BoundaryTester`: Utility for testing contract boundary conditions
- `FuzzGenerator`: Utility for generating fuzz test inputs
- `PropertyValidator`: Utility for validating contract properties and behaviors

### Key Features
- Soroban-optimized property-based testing patterns
- Comprehensive security validation (property validation, invariant checking)
- Gas-efficient operations
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation and usage examples

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/property-testing/`
- Testing: `contracts/property-testing/src/test.rs` with 120+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/property-testing/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using raw property tests**: Rejected due to security risks and lack of validation
2. **Implementing utilities in each contract separately**: Rejected due to code duplication and inconsistency
3. **Using external libraries**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
