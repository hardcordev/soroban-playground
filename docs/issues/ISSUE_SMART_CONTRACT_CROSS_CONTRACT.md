title: "[SMART CONTRACT] Implement Soroban Cross-Contract Call Utilities"
labels: enhancement, smart-contract, high-priority

## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a set of Soroban-specific cross-contract call utility contracts that provide reusable, secure patterns for inter-contract communication. These utilities will improve developer productivity and reduce security risks in complex contract interactions.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Developers building complex Soroban applications need to implement cross-contract calls between different contracts (e.g., synthetic assets calling price oracles). Current implementations require custom code for each interaction, leading to inconsistent security practices, increased development time, and potential vulnerabilities. Standardized, audited cross-contract utilities would significantly improve security and developer experience.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive set of cross-contract call utility contracts including:
- `CrossContractCaller`: Secure wrapper for making cross-contract calls with validation
- `ContractRegistry`: Central registry for discovering and verifying contract addresses
- `CallValidator`: Utility for validating contract interfaces and function signatures
- `BatchCaller`: Utility for executing multiple cross-contract calls atomically
- `FallbackHandler`: Utility for handling failed cross-contract calls gracefully

### Key Features
- Soroban-optimized cross-contract call patterns
- Comprehensive security validation (address verification, interface checking)
- Gas-efficient operations
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation and usage examples

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/cross-contract-utils/`
- Testing: `contracts/cross-contract-utils/src/test.rs` with 120+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/cross-contract-utils/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using raw cross-contract calls**: Rejected due to security risks and lack of validation
2. **Implementing utilities in each contract separately**: Rejected due to code duplication and inconsistency
3. **Using external libraries**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
