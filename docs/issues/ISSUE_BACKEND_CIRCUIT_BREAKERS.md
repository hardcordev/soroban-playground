labels: enhancement, backend, high-priority
assignees: ''

## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement circuit breaker and timeout handling for all backend API endpoints. This will prevent cascading failures and ensure system resilience during dependency outages.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current backend lacks circuit breaker patterns and timeout handling, making it vulnerable to cascading failures when dependencies (database, Redis, Soroban CLI) become unavailable. Without circuit breakers, a single failing dependency can cause the entire application to become unresponsive. Circuit breakers are essential for production-ready resilience.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive circuit breaker implementation with:
- Automatic circuit breaker pattern for all external dependencies
- Configurable timeout handling for API endpoints
- Fallback mechanisms and graceful degradation
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Integration with existing middleware

### Key Features
- Circuit breaker pattern for database connections
- Circuit breaker pattern for Redis cache connections
- Circuit breaker pattern for Soroban CLI interactions
- Configurable timeouts for all API endpoints
- Fallback mechanisms for failed operations
- Real-time circuit breaker status monitoring

### Implementation Details
- Location: `backend/src/middleware/circuitBreaker.js`
- Service: `backend/src/services/circuitBreakerService.js`
- Configuration: `backend/src/config/circuitBreaker.config.js`
- Documentation: `backend/src/docs/circuitBreaker.doc.js`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **No circuit breakers**: Rejected because MVP requires production resilience
2. **Basic timeout handling only**: Rejected because comprehensive resilience requires full implementation
3. **External circuit breaker services**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization
