## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement distributed tracing and request tracking for the Soroban Playground backend. This will enable detailed performance analysis, debugging of complex request flows, and identification of bottlenecks.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current backend lacks distributed tracing capabilities, making it difficult to debug complex request flows and identify performance bottlenecks. Without tracing, developers cannot understand how requests flow through the system or identify slow components. Tracing is essential for production-ready performance optimization.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive distributed tracing implementation with:
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Automatic instrumentation of all API routes
- Trace propagation across service boundaries
- Integration with monitoring and observability
- Visualization and analysis capabilities

### Key Features
- Automatic tracing of all HTTP requests
- Trace propagation between frontend → backend → Soroban CLI
- Integration with Prometheus metrics
- Trace visualization in Grafana
- Export to Jaeger or Zipkin
- Performance bottleneck identification

### Implementation Details
- Location: `backend/src/tracing/`
- Service: `backend/src/services/tracingService.js`
- Configuration: `backend/src/config/tracing.config.js`
- Documentation: `backend/src/docs/tracing.doc.js`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **No tracing**: Rejected because MVP requires performance optimization
2. **Basic logging only**: Rejected because distributed tracing requires full implementation
3. **External tracing services**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization
