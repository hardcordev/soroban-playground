## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a set of Soroban contract debugging utilities that provide reusable, secure patterns for contract debugging and analysis. These utilities will improve developer productivity and reduce debugging time.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Developers building Soroban contracts currently need to implement custom debugging logic for each contract. This leads to inconsistent debugging practices, increased development time, and potential security risks. Standardized, audited debugging utilities would significantly improve debugging quality and developer experience.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive set of debugging utility contracts including:
- `DebugLogger`: Utility for logging debug information during contract execution
- `StateInspector`: Utility for inspecting contract state during debugging
- `ExecutionTracer`: Utility for tracing contract execution paths
- `GasProfiler`: Utility for profiling gas usage of contract functions
- `ErrorDebugger`: Utility for enhanced error reporting and debugging

### Key Features
- Soroban-optimized debugging patterns
- Comprehensive security validation (log sanitization, state validation)
- Gas-efficient operations
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation and usage examples

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/debugging-utils/`
- Testing: `contracts/debugging-utils/src/test.rs` with 100+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/debugging-utils/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using raw debug calls**: Rejected due to security risks and lack of validation
2. **Implementing utilities in each contract separately**: Rejected due to code duplication and inconsistency
3. **Using external libraries**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
