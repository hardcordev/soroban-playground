## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement comprehensive health checks and status endpoints for the Soroban Playground backend. This will enable monitoring of system health, dependency status, and operational readiness.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current backend lacks comprehensive health check capabilities, making it difficult to monitor system health and dependency status. Without health checks, developers and operators cannot verify system readiness or identify failing dependencies. Health checks are essential for production-ready infrastructure.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive health check implementation with:
- Liveness and readiness probes
- Dependency health checks (database, Redis, Soroban CLI)
- Custom health check endpoints
- Integration with monitoring and observability
- Status dashboard integration

### Key Features
- `/health/live` endpoint for liveness checks
- `/health/ready` endpoint for readiness checks
- `/health/status` endpoint for detailed status information
- Database connection health checks
- Redis cache health checks
- Soroban CLI availability checks

### Implementation Details
- Location: `backend/src/health/`
- Service: `backend/src/services/healthService.js`
- Configuration: `backend/src/config/health.config.js`
- Documentation: `backend/src/docs/health.doc.js`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **No health checks**: Rejected because MVP requires production monitoring
2. **Basic ping endpoint only**: Rejected because comprehensive health checks require full implementation
3. **External health check services**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization
