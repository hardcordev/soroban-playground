## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement favorites and recent templates functionality for the contract template library. This will enable developers to quickly access their most commonly used templates.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current template browsing requires manual navigation through the directory structure each time. Without favorites and recent templates, developers must repeatedly search for commonly used templates, wasting time and reducing productivity. Favorites and recent templates are essential for improving developer efficiency.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive favorites and recent templates implementation with:
- Template favoriting and management
- Recent templates tracking and display
- Favorites organization and categorization
- Sync across devices and sessions
- Performance optimization for large template sets

### Key Features
- One-click favoriting of templates
- Favorites sidebar with quick access
- Recent templates section showing last accessed templates
- Favorites organization by category or custom tags
- Local storage and optional cloud sync
- Search within favorites and recent templates

### Implementation Details
- Location: `frontend/src/app/template-library/page.tsx`
- Components: `frontend/src/components/FavoritesManager.tsx`, `RecentTemplates.tsx`
- Integration with existing contract metadata and README files

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual directory navigation only**: Rejected because MVP requires improved developer experience
2. **Basic favorites only**: Rejected because comprehensive management requires full implementation
3. **Backend-only favorites API**: Rejected because frontend UI is essential for developer experience
