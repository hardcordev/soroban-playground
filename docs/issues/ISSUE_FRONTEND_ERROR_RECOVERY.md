## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement comprehensive error recovery and user guidance across the entire Soroban Playground UI. This will improve developer experience by providing helpful error messages, recovery options, and contextual guidance.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current UI provides generic error messages without actionable guidance or recovery options. Without comprehensive error recovery, developers struggle to understand and resolve issues, leading to frustration and reduced productivity. Error recovery is essential for professional developer experience.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive error recovery implementation with:
- Contextual error messages with actionable guidance
- Automatic error recovery where possible
- Step-by-step troubleshooting guides
- Integration with documentation and help resources
- User-friendly error reporting

### Key Features
- Contextual error messages with specific causes and solutions
- One-click recovery actions (retry, reset, clear cache)
- Step-by-step troubleshooting wizards for common errors
- Integration with documentation and community resources
- Anonymous error reporting with consent
- Visual indicators for error states and recovery options

### Implementation Details
- Location: `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` (error boundary)
- Components: `frontend/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`, `ErrorRecoveryWizard.tsx`
- Integration with existing Next.js app router and error handling

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Generic error messages only**: Rejected because MVP requires professional developer experience
2. **Basic error handling only**: Rejected because comprehensive recovery requires full implementation
3. **Backend-only error API**: Rejected because frontend implementation is essential for UX
