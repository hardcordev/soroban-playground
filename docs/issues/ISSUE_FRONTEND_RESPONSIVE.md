## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement comprehensive responsive design and mobile optimization across the entire Soroban Playground UI. This will improve usability for developers using tablets and mobile devices.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current UI is optimized for desktop use only and lacks responsive design for smaller screens. Without responsive design, developers cannot effectively use the application on tablets or mobile devices, limiting accessibility and flexibility. Responsive design is essential for modern developer experience.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive responsive design implementation with:
- Mobile-first design approach
- Responsive layout adjustments for all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Adaptive navigation patterns
- Performance optimization for mobile devices

### Key Features
- Responsive grid system for all UI components
- Mobile-optimized navigation (hamburger menu, tab bar)
- Touch-friendly controls (larger tap targets, swipe gestures)
- Adaptive editor layout for smaller screens
- Performance optimizations (lazy loading, code splitting)
- Offline support for core functionality

### Implementation Details
- Location: `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` (responsive provider)
- Components: `frontend/src/components/ResponsiveNav.tsx`, `MobileEditor.tsx`
- Styling: `frontend/src/styles/responsive.css`, `frontend/src/styles/mobile.css`
- Integration with existing Next.js app router

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Desktop-only design**: Rejected because MVP requires modern developer experience
2. **Basic responsive fixes only**: Rejected because comprehensive mobile optimization requires full implementation
3. **Backend-only responsive API**: Rejected because frontend implementation is essential for UX
