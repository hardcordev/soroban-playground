## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a set of Soroban contract analysis and verification utilities that provide reusable, secure patterns for automated contract analysis. These utilities will improve developer productivity and reduce security risks in contract development.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Developers building Soroban contracts currently need to implement custom analysis logic for each contract. This leads to inconsistent analysis practices, increased development time, and potential security gaps. Standardized, audited analysis utilities would significantly improve contract quality and developer experience.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive set of analysis utility contracts including:
- `ContractAnalyzer`: Secure wrapper for contract analysis with static analysis
- `SecurityScanner`: Utility for scanning contracts for security vulnerabilities
- `GasAnalyzer`: Utility for analyzing gas usage and optimization opportunities
- `CodeQualityChecker`: Utility for checking code quality and best practices
- `VerificationEngine`: Utility for formal verification of contract properties

### Key Features
- Soroban-optimized analysis patterns
- Comprehensive security validation (vulnerability scanning, gas analysis)
- Gas-efficient operations
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation and usage examples

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/analysis-utils/`
- Testing: `contracts/analysis-utils/src/test.rs` with 100+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/analysis-utils/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using raw analysis tools**: Rejected due to security risks and lack of validation
2. **Implementing utilities in each contract separately**: Rejected due to code duplication and inconsistency
3. **Using external libraries**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
