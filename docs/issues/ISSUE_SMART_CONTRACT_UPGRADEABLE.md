## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a production-ready upgradeable contract pattern that enables developers to update Soroban contract logic while preserving state and address. This will allow continuous improvement of applications without disrupting users.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Soroban applications currently cannot be upgraded after deployment, creating significant maintenance challenges. Without upgradeable patterns, developers must deploy new contracts for every update, breaking existing integrations and requiring users to migrate funds. Upgradeable patterns are essential for production-ready applications that require ongoing maintenance and improvement.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive upgradeable contract implementation with:
- Standard upgradeable interface compliance
- Flexible configuration (implementation address, admin control, upgrade permissions, initialization)
- Comprehensive security features (admin validation, upgrade timing controls, initialization protection)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, property-based)
- Documentation and examples

### Key Features
- `initialize()`, `upgradeTo()`, `upgradeToAndCall()` functions for upgrade management
- `isInitialized()`, `getImplementation()` for state management
- Event emissions (`Initialized`, `Upgraded`, `UpgradedAndCalled`)
- Security features: admin validation, upgrade timing controls, initialization protection

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/upgradeable/`
- Testing: `contracts/upgradeable/src/test.rs` with 80+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/upgradeable/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using existing third-party implementations**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
2. **Non-upgradeable contracts only**: Rejected because MVP requires ongoing maintenance capabilities
3. **Frontend-only upgrade UI**: Rejected because upgradeable logic must be on-chain for security
