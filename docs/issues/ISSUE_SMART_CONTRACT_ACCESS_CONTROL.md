## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a set of flexible access control contract patterns that provide reusable, secure mechanisms for managing permissions and roles across Soroban applications. These patterns will improve security and developer productivity for permissioned systems.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Developers building permissioned Soroban applications need to implement custom access control logic for each contract. This leads to inconsistent security practices, increased development time, and potential vulnerabilities. Standardized, audited access control patterns would significantly improve security and developer experience.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive set of access control patterns including:
- `Ownable`: Simple ownership pattern with transfer functionality
- `RoleBasedAccessControl`: Hierarchical role-based permissions system
- `MultiSigAccessControl`: Multi-signature based access control
- `TimelockAccessControl`: Time-delayed permission changes
- `ConditionalAccessControl`: Context-aware permission checking

### Key Features
- Soroban-optimized access control patterns
- Comprehensive security validation (role inheritance, permission checking)
- Gas-efficient operations
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation and usage examples

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/access-control/`
- Testing: `contracts/access-control/src/test.rs` with 100+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/access-control/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using raw require_auth() calls**: Rejected due to lack of flexibility and security features
2. **Implementing access control in each contract separately**: Rejected due to code duplication and inconsistency
3. **Using external libraries**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
