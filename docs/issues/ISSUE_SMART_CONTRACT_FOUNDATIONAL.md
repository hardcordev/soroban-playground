about: Implement foundational Soroban contract standards and utilities
title: "[SMART CONTRACT] Implement ERC-20 Token Standard Contract"
labels: enhancement, smart-contract, high-priority
assignees: ''
---

## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a production-ready ERC-20 token standard contract for Soroban that follows best practices for security, gas efficiency, and Soroban-specific patterns. This will serve as the foundational token standard for all other contract integrations.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The Soroban Playground currently lacks a standardized, audited ERC-20 implementation. Developers need a reliable, production-ready token standard to build upon for various use cases (governance tokens, utility tokens, stablecoins). Without this foundational contract, developers must implement their own token standards, increasing security risks and development time.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive ERC-20 implementation with:
- Standard ERC-20 interface compliance
- Soroban-specific optimizations (storage layout, cross-contract calls)
- Security best practices (reentrancy protection, overflow/underflow prevention)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, property-based)
- Documentation and examples

### Key Features
- `totalSupply()`, `balanceOf()`, `transfer()`, `transferFrom()` functions
- `approve()`, `allowance()` for delegated transfers
- Event emissions (`Transfer`, `Approval`)
- Optional extensions: minting, burning, pausing

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/erc-20/`
- Testing: `contracts/erc-20/src/test.rs` with 100+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/erc-20/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using existing third-party implementations**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
2. **Minimal implementation without extensions**: Rejected because MVP requires production-ready features
3. **ERC-721 instead of ERC-20**: Rejected because ERC-20 is more fundamental for financial infrastructure
