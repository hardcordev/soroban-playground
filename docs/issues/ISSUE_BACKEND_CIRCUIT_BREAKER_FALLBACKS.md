title: "[BACKEND] Implement Circuit Breaker Fallback Mechanisms and Graceful Degradation"
labels: enhancement, backend, high-priority
assignees: ''
---

## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement circuit breaker fallback mechanisms and graceful degradation for all backend API endpoints. This will ensure system availability during partial failures.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current backend lacks circuit breaker fallback mechanisms, making it difficult to maintain functionality during partial failures. Without fallbacks, users experience complete service outages when dependencies fail. Fallback mechanisms are essential for production-ready availability.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive circuit breaker fallback implementation with:
- Configurable fallback mechanisms per endpoint
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Fallback status monitoring and alerting
- Integration with existing error handling

### Key Features
- Configurable fallback mechanisms (caching, defaults, alternative services)
- Graceful degradation strategies for different failure scenarios
- Fallback status monitoring and alerting
- Integration with existing error handling and logging
- Fallback execution metrics and performance monitoring

### Implementation Details
- Location: `backend/src/middleware/fallback.js`
- Service: `backend/src/services/fallbackService.js`
- Configuration: `backend/src/config/fallback.config.js`
- Documentation: `backend/src/docs/fallback.doc.js`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **No fallbacks**: Rejected because MVP requires production availability
2. **Basic fallback only**: Rejected because comprehensive fallback requires full implementation
3. **External fallback services**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization
