title: "[SMART CONTRACT] Implement ERC-721 NFT Standard Contract"
labels: enhancement, smart-contract, high-priority
assignees: ''

## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a production-ready ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token standard contract for Soroban that follows best practices for security, gas efficiency, and Soroban-specific patterns. This will serve as the foundational NFT standard for digital collectibles, art, and other unique assets.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The Soroban Playground currently lacks a standardized, audited ERC-721 implementation. Developers need a reliable, production-ready NFT standard to build upon for various use cases (digital art, collectibles, gaming assets). Without this foundational contract, developers must implement their own NFT standards, increasing security risks and development time.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive ERC-721 implementation with:
- Standard ERC-721 interface compliance
- Soroban-specific optimizations (storage layout, cross-contract calls)
- Security best practices (reentrancy protection, overflow/underflow prevention)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, property-based)
- Documentation and examples

### Key Features
- `totalSupply()`, `balanceOf()`, `ownerOf()`, `transferFrom()`, `safeTransferFrom()` functions
- `approve()`, `getApproved()`, `setApprovalForAll()`, `isApprovedForAll()` for permissions
- Event emissions (`Transfer`, `Approval`, `ApprovalForAll`)
- Optional extensions: enumerable, metadata, royalties

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/erc-721/`
- Testing: `contracts/erc-721/src/test.rs` with 100+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/erc-721/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using existing third-party implementations**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
2. **Minimal implementation without extensions**: Rejected because MVP requires production-ready features
3. **ERC-1155 instead of ERC-721**: Rejected because ERC-721 is more fundamental for unique asset use cases
