## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement comprehensive network selection and configuration for the contract deployment wizard. This will enable developers to deploy to different networks with appropriate configuration.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current deployment process requires developers to manually configure network settings. Without network selection, developers must remember and enter complex RPC endpoints, making deployment error-prone and time-consuming. Network selection is essential for improving developer experience and reducing deployment errors.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive network selection implementation with:
- Pre-configured network options (Stellar Testnet, Futurenet, custom)
- Network-specific configuration and validation
- Real-time network status checking
- Custom network configuration
- Network documentation and guidance

### Key Features
- Pre-configured network options with automatic configuration
- Network status indicators (online, offline, slow)
- Custom network configuration with validation
- Network documentation and usage guidance
- Automatic configuration of network-specific parameters
- Network health checks before deployment

### Implementation Details
- Location: `frontend/src/app/deploy-wizard/page.tsx`
- Components: `frontend/src/components/NetworkSelector.tsx`, `NetworkStatusIndicator.tsx`
- Integration with backend deployment API routes

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual network configuration only**: Rejected because MVP requires improved developer experience
2. **Basic network dropdown only**: Rejected because comprehensive selection requires status and validation
3. **Backend-only network API**: Rejected because frontend UI is essential for developer experience
