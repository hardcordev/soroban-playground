## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a production-ready versioned contract pattern that enables developers to manage multiple versions of Soroban contract logic while preserving state and address. This will allow gradual adoption of new features and backward compatibility.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Soroban applications currently cannot support multiple versions of contract logic simultaneously, creating challenges for gradual feature adoption and backward compatibility. Without versioned patterns, developers must force all users to migrate to new versions immediately, potentially breaking integrations. Versioned patterns are essential for production-ready applications that require gradual evolution.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive versioned contract implementation with:
- Standard versioned interface compliance
- Flexible configuration (version mapping, compatibility rules, migration paths)
- Comprehensive security features (version validation, compatibility checking, migration protection)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, property-based)
- Documentation and examples

### Key Features
- `getVersion()`, `setVersion()`, `getCompatibleVersions()` functions for version management
- `migrateToVersion()`, `rollbackToVersion()` for version transitions
- Event emissions (`VersionSet`, `VersionMigrated`, `VersionRolledBack`)
- Security features: version validation, compatibility checking, migration protection

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/versioned/`
- Testing: `contracts/versioned/src/test.rs` with 70+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/versioned/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using existing third-party implementations**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
2. **Single-version contracts only**: Rejected because MVP requires gradual feature adoption
3. **Frontend-only version UI**: Rejected because versioned logic must be on-chain for security
