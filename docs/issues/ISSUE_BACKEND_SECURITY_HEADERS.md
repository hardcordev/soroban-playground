## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement comprehensive security headers and input sanitization for the Soroban Playground backend. This will protect against common web vulnerabilities and ensure secure data handling.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current backend lacks comprehensive security headers and input sanitization, making it vulnerable to common web attacks. Without security headers, the application is vulnerable to XSS, clickjacking, and other attacks. Without input sanitization, malicious input could cause security issues. Security headers are essential for production-ready infrastructure.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive security implementation with:
- Security HTTP headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, XSS-Protection, etc.)
- Input sanitization and validation
- Output encoding
- Security audit logging
- Compliance reporting capabilities

### Key Features
- Content Security Policy (CSP) header configuration
- X-Frame-Options and X-Content-Type-Options headers
- XSS protection and input sanitization
- Output encoding for all user-generated content
- Security audit logging with sensitive operation tracking
- Compliance reporting for security standards

### Implementation Details
- Location: `backend/src/middleware/security.js`
- Service: `backend/src/services/securityService.js`
- Configuration: `backend/src/config/security.config.js`
- Documentation: `backend/src/docs/security.doc.js`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **No security headers**: Rejected because MVP requires production security
2. **Basic security headers only**: Rejected because comprehensive security requires full implementation
3. **External security services**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization
