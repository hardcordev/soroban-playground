## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a set of Soroban contract simulation contracts that provide reusable, secure patterns for simulating contract behavior. These simulations will improve developer productivity and reduce risks during development.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Developers building Soroban contracts currently need to implement custom simulation logic for each contract. This leads to inconsistent simulation practices, increased development time, and potential security risks. Standardized, audited simulation contracts would significantly improve simulation quality and developer experience.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive set of simulation contracts including:
- `SimulationEngine`: Secure wrapper for contract simulation with mock environments
- `MarketSimulator`: Utility for simulating market conditions and price movements
- `OracleSimulator`: Utility for simulating oracle data feeds and responses
- `TokenSimulator`: Utility for simulating token interactions and transfers
- `VotingSimulator`: Utility for simulating voting scenarios and outcomes

### Key Features
- Soroban-optimized simulation patterns
- Comprehensive security validation (simulation validation, boundary checking)
- Gas-efficient operations
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation and usage examples

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/simulation/`
- Testing: `contracts/simulation/src/test.rs` with 100+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/simulation/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using raw simulation calls**: Rejected due to security risks and lack of validation
2. **Implementing utilities in each contract separately**: Rejected due to code duplication and inconsistency
3. **Using external libraries**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
