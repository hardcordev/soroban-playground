## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement structured logging and log aggregation for the Soroban Playground backend. This will enable efficient log analysis, debugging, and operational insights.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current backend lacks structured logging capabilities, making it difficult to analyze logs programmatically and gain operational insights. Without structured logging, developers cannot efficiently search, filter, and analyze log data. Structured logging is essential for production-ready operations.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive structured logging implementation with:
- JSON-based structured logging
- Log aggregation and centralization
- Log rotation and retention policies
- Integration with monitoring and observability
- Contextual logging with request IDs

### Key Features
- JSON-formatted structured logs with consistent fields
- Centralized log aggregation with Elasticsearch or Loki
- Log rotation and configurable retention policies
- Contextual logging with unique request IDs
- Integration with Prometheus metrics and Grafana
- Log analysis and filtering capabilities

### Implementation Details
- Location: `backend/src/logging/`
- Service: `backend/src/services/loggingService.js`
- Configuration: `backend/src/config/logging.config.js`
- Documentation: `backend/src/docs/logging.doc.js`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Unstructured logging**: Rejected because MVP requires efficient log analysis
2. **Basic console logging only**: Rejected because structured logging requires full implementation
3. **External logging services**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization
