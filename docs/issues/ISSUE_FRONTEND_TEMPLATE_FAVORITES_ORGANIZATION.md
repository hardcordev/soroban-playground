## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement favorites organization and categorization for the contract template library. This will enable developers to organize their favorite templates into custom categories and tags.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current template browsing requires manual navigation through the directory structure each time. Without favorites organization, developers cannot categorize their commonly used templates, making it difficult to find specific templates when needed. Favorites organization is essential for improving developer efficiency and template management.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive favorites organization implementation with:
- Custom category creation and management
- Tag-based organization
- Favorites sorting and filtering
- Search within favorites
- Favorites export and import

### Key Features
- Create custom categories for organizing favorites
- Add tags to favorites for flexible categorization
- Sort favorites by name, category, date added, etc.
- Filter favorites by category or tag
- Search within favorites list
- Export favorites to JSON for backup
- Import favorites from JSON backup

### Implementation Details
- Location: `frontend/src/app/template-library/page.tsx`
- Components: `frontend/src/components/FavoritesManager.tsx`, `CategoryManager.tsx`
- Integration with existing contract metadata and README files

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual directory navigation only**: Rejected because MVP requires improved developer experience
2. **Basic favorites only**: Rejected because comprehensive organization requires full implementation
3. **Backend-only favorites API**: Rejected because frontend UI is essential for developer experience
