title: "[SMART CONTRACT] Implement Proxy Contract Pattern for Upgradeable Contracts"
labels: enhancement, smart-contract, high-priority

## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a production-ready proxy contract pattern that enables upgradeable Soroban contracts. This will allow developers to update contract logic without changing contract addresses, enabling continuous improvement and bug fixes.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Soroban contracts currently cannot be upgraded after deployment, creating significant maintenance challenges. Without upgradeable contracts, developers must deploy new contracts for every update, breaking existing integrations and requiring users to migrate funds. Proxy patterns are essential for production-ready applications that require ongoing maintenance and improvement.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive proxy implementation with:
- Standard proxy interface compliance
- Flexible configuration (implementation address, admin control, upgrade permissions)
- Comprehensive security features (admin validation, upgrade timing controls, rollback capabilities)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, property-based)
- Documentation and examples

### Key Features
- `upgradeTo()`, `upgradeToAndCall()`, `getImplementation()` functions for upgrade management
- `changeAdmin()`, `getAdmin()` for admin management
- Event emissions (`Upgraded`, `AdminChanged`, `UpgradedAndCalled`)
- Security features: admin validation, upgrade timing controls, rollback capabilities

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/proxy/`
- Testing: `contracts/proxy/src/test.rs` with 80+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/proxy/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using existing third-party implementations**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
2. **Non-upgradeable contracts only**: Rejected because MVP requires ongoing maintenance capabilities
3. **Frontend-only upgrade UI**: Rejected because proxy logic must be on-chain for security
