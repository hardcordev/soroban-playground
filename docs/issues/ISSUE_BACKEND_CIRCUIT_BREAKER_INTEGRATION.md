## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement circuit breaker integration with monitoring and observability systems. This will enable proactive detection of circuit breaker trips and system health analysis.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current backend lacks circuit breaker integration with monitoring systems, making it difficult to detect when circuit breakers are tripped and analyze system health. Without monitoring integration, developers and operators cannot proactively respond to circuit breaker events or understand system health patterns. Monitoring integration is essential for production-ready operations.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive circuit breaker monitoring integration with:
- Prometheus metrics for circuit breaker status
- Grafana dashboard integration
- Alerting for circuit breaker trips
- Circuit breaker status history and analytics
- Integration with existing monitoring stack

### Key Features
- Prometheus metrics for circuit breaker status (open, half-open, closed)
- Grafana dashboard showing circuit breaker status across all dependencies
- Alerting for circuit breaker trips and failures
- Circuit breaker status history and trend analysis
- Integration with existing monitoring and observability stack

### Implementation Details
- Location: `backend/src/metrics/circuitBreaker.js`
- Service: `backend/src/services/circuitBreakerMonitoringService.js`
- Configuration: `backend/src/config/circuitBreakerMonitoring.config.js`
- Documentation: `backend/src/docs/circuitBreakerMonitoring.doc.js`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **No monitoring integration**: Rejected because MVP requires production observability
2. **Basic metrics only**: Rejected because comprehensive monitoring requires full integration
3. **External monitoring services**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization
