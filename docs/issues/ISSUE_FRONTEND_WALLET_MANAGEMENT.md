## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a comprehensive wallet connection management UI that allows developers to connect, manage, and switch between multiple Stellar wallets. This will significantly improve the wallet interaction experience.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Developers currently need to manually configure wallet connections through CLI commands or browser extensions. Without a dedicated wallet management UI, developers struggle with connection issues, cannot easily switch between accounts, and have poor visibility into connection status. A comprehensive wallet management UI is essential for improving developer experience and productivity.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive wallet connection management UI with:
- Multi-wallet connection support
- Account switching and management
- Connection status monitoring
- Transaction signing interface
- Wallet detection and onboarding

### Key Features
- Wallet connection wizard with Freighter, Soroban Wallet, and other compatible wallets
- Account switching between multiple connected wallets
- Connection status indicators (connected, disconnected, error)
- Transaction signing interface with gas estimation and fee display
- Wallet detection and automatic onboarding
- Connection history and recent accounts

### Implementation Details
- Location: `frontend/src/app/wallet-management/page.tsx`
- Components: `frontend/src/components/WalletConnectionWizard.tsx`, `AccountSwitcher.tsx`, `TransactionSigner.tsx`
- Integration with Freighter extension and Stellar SDK

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual wallet configuration only**: Rejected because MVP requires improved developer experience
2. **Basic connection button only**: Rejected because comprehensive management requires rich UI
3. **Backend-only wallet API**: Rejected because frontend UI is essential for developer experience
