title: "[SMART CONTRACT] Implement Sports Results Oracle Contract"
labels: enhancement, smart-contract, high-priority

## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a production-ready sports results oracle contract that provides reliable, tamper-resistant sports data for Soroban applications. This will enable secure prediction markets, sports betting, and other sports data-dependent applications.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Applications like prediction markets and sports betting currently lack reliable sports data sources. Without sports oracles, these applications cannot function reliably or securely. Sports oracles are essential for production-ready prediction market applications.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive sports results oracle implementation with:
- Standard sports data interface compliance
- Multiple data source integration (official league APIs, sports data providers, manual verification)
- Comprehensive security features (data validation, outlier detection, circuit breakers)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, property-based)
- Documentation and examples

### Key Features
- `submitSportsData()`, `getSportsData()`, `getHistoricalResults()` functions for sports management
- `addDataSource()`, `removeDataSource()`, `setVerificationThreshold()` for source management
- Event emissions (`SportsDataSubmitted`, `SportsDataVerified`, `CircuitBreakerActivated`)
- Security features: data validation, outlier detection, circuit breakers

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/sports-oracle/`
- Testing: `contracts/sports-oracle/src/test.rs` with 70+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/sports-oracle/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using existing third-party implementations**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
2. **Single-source sports data only**: Rejected because MVP requires reliability for prediction markets
3. **Frontend-only sports UI**: Rejected because sports oracle logic must be on-chain for security
