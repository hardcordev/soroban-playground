## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a production-ready timelock contract that enables delayed execution of critical administrative operations. This will provide essential security for governance and administrative functions across all Soroban applications.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Critical administrative operations (contract upgrades, parameter changes, emergency pauses) currently lack time-delayed execution capabilities. Without timelocks, malicious actors who compromise admin keys could immediately execute harmful operations. Timelocks provide a crucial safety mechanism by requiring a waiting period before critical operations can be executed.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive timelock implementation with:
- Standard timelock interface compliance
- Flexible configuration (minimum delay, maximum delay, grace period)
- Comprehensive security features (cancellation, queueing, execution validation)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, property-based)
- Documentation and examples

### Key Features
- `schedule()`, `execute()`, `cancel()` functions for operation management
- `getMinDelay()`, `getMaxDelay()`, `getGracePeriod()` for configuration
- Event emissions (`Scheduled`, `Executed`, `Cancelled`)
- Security features: operation cancellation, queue validation, execution timing checks

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/timelock/`
- Testing: `contracts/timelock/src/test.rs` with 80+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/timelock/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using existing third-party implementations**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
2. **Minimal implementation without security features**: Rejected because MVP requires production-ready security
3. **Frontend-only timelock UI**: Rejected because timelock logic must be on-chain for security
