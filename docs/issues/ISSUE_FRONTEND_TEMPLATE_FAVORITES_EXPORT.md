## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement favorites export and import functionality for the contract template library. This will enable developers to backup their favorites and share them with others.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current template browsing requires manual navigation through the directory structure each time. Without favorites export/import, developers cannot backup their favorites or share them with team members, creating workflow fragmentation and data loss risk. Favorites export/import is essential for improving developer collaboration and data safety.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive favorites export/import implementation with:
- JSON-based favorites export
- Favorites import from JSON files
- Favorites sharing and collaboration
- Backup and restore capabilities
- Import validation and conflict resolution

### Key Features
- Export favorites to JSON file with metadata
- Import favorites from JSON file
- Share favorites via link or file
- Backup and restore favorites with versioning
- Import validation and conflict resolution
- Favorites import history and audit trail

### Implementation Details
- Location: `frontend/src/app/template-library/page.tsx`
- Components: `frontend/src/components/FavoritesExportManager.tsx`, `FavoritesImportManager.tsx`
- Integration with existing contract metadata and README files

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual directory navigation only**: Rejected because MVP requires improved developer experience
2. **Local-only favorites only**: Rejected because export/import requires cross-device capabilities
3. **Backend-only favorites API**: Rejected because frontend UI is essential for developer experience
