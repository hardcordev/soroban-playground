## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement search functionality for the contract template library favorites. This will enable developers to quickly find their favorite templates using keywords and filters.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current template browsing requires manual navigation through the directory structure each time. Without favorites search, developers must scroll through long lists of favorites to find specific templates, wasting time and reducing productivity. Favorites search is essential for improving developer efficiency with large favorites collections.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive favorites search implementation with:
- Full-text search across favorites
- Filter by category and tags
- Search history and suggestions
- Performance optimization for large favorites sets

### Key Features
- Full-text search across all favorite templates
- Filter favorites by category, tags, and metadata
- Search history and recent searches
- Smart suggestions based on search terms
- Performance optimization for large favorites collections
- Search within favorites only option

### Implementation Details
- Location: `frontend/src/app/template-library/page.tsx`
- Components: `frontend/src/components/FavoritesSearchBar.tsx`, `FavoritesFilter.tsx`
- Integration with existing contract metadata and README files

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual directory navigation only**: Rejected because MVP requires improved developer experience
2. **Basic favorites search only**: Rejected because comprehensive search requires full implementation
3. **Backend-only favorites search API**: Rejected because frontend UI is essential for developer experience
