## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a production-ready multisig wallet contract that enables decentralized governance through multi-signature requirements. This will provide essential security for treasury management and administrative functions across all Soroban applications.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Treasury management and critical administrative operations currently lack multi-signature protection. Without multisig, single points of failure exist where compromised admin keys could immediately drain funds or execute harmful operations. Multisig provides essential security by requiring multiple independent approvals for critical operations.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive multisig implementation with:
- Standard multisig interface compliance
- Flexible configuration (threshold, signers, minimum/maximum delay)
- Comprehensive security features (transaction queuing, cancellation, execution validation)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, property-based)
- Documentation and examples

### Key Features
- `submitTransaction()`, `confirmTransaction()`, `executeTransaction()` for operation management
- `addOwner()`, `removeOwner()`, `changeThreshold()` for configuration
- Event emissions (`Submission`, `Confirmation`, `Execution`, `OwnerAddition`, `OwnerRemoval`)
- Security features: transaction queuing, cancellation, execution timing checks

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/multisig/`
- Testing: `contracts/multisig/src/test.rs` with 90+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/multisig/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using existing third-party implementations**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
2. **Minimal implementation without security features**: Rejected because MVP requires production-ready security
3. **Frontend-only multisig UI**: Rejected because multisig logic must be on-chain for security
