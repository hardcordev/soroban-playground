## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement favorites synchronization across devices and sessions for the contract template library. This will enable developers to access their favorite templates from any device.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current template browsing requires manual navigation through the directory structure each time. Without favorites sync, developers cannot access their favorite templates from different devices, reducing productivity and creating workflow fragmentation. Favorites sync is essential for improving developer efficiency across devices.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive favorites sync implementation with:
- Cloud-based favorites storage
- Local storage fallback
- Conflict resolution and merging
- Sync status indicators
- Manual sync controls

### Key Features
- Cloud-based favorites storage with encryption
- Local storage fallback when offline
- Conflict resolution for conflicting favorites
- Sync status indicators (syncing, synced, error)
- Manual sync controls (sync now, sync settings)
- Favorites sync history and versioning

### Implementation Details
- Location: `frontend/src/app/template-library/page.tsx`
- Components: `frontend/src/components/FavoritesSyncManager.tsx`, `SyncStatusIndicator.tsx`
- Integration with backend favorites API routes

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual directory navigation only**: Rejected because MVP requires improved developer experience
2. **Local-only favorites only**: Rejected because cross-device sync requires cloud integration
3. **Backend-only favorites API**: Rejected because frontend UI is essential for developer experience
