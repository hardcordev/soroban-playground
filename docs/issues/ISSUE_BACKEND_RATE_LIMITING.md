## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement comprehensive rate limiting and abuse protection for all backend API endpoints. This will prevent abuse, ensure fair resource usage, and protect against denial-of-service attacks.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Backend API endpoints currently lack rate limiting, making them vulnerable to abuse and denial-of-service attacks. Without rate limiting, malicious actors could overwhelm the service, causing outages and degraded performance for legitimate users. Rate limiting is essential for production-ready infrastructure.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive rate limiting service with:
- Per-endpoint rate limiting configuration
- IP-based and token-based rate limiting
- Configurable limits (requests per minute/hour)
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Integration with existing middleware

### Key Features
- `POST /rate-limit/config`: Configure rate limiting rules
- `GET /rate-limit/status`: Get current rate limiting status
- `GET /rate-limit/logs`: View rate limiting logs
- Middleware integration for all API routes
- Configurable limits per endpoint (compile, deploy, invoke, etc.)

### Implementation Details
- Location: `backend/src/middleware/rateLimit.js`
- Service: `backend/src/services/rateLimitService.js`
- Database: PostgreSQL table `rate_limit_logs`
- Configuration: `backend/src/config/rateLimit.config.js`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **No rate limiting**: Rejected because MVP requires production security
2. **Frontend-only rate limiting**: Rejected because backend protection is essential
3. **External rate limiting services**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization
