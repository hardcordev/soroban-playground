## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement intelligent retry logic and fallback mechanisms for all backend API endpoints. This will improve system reliability and user experience during transient failures.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current backend lacks intelligent retry logic, making it vulnerable to transient failures like network timeouts, temporary database unavailability, or rate limiting. Without intelligent retries, users experience failures that could be resolved with automatic retries. Retry logic is essential for production-ready reliability.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive retry implementation with:
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Configurable retry policies per endpoint
- Fallback mechanisms for critical operations
- Real-time retry monitoring and alerting
- Integration with existing middleware

### Key Features
- Exponential backoff retry logic for all external dependencies
- Configurable retry policies (max retries, timeout, jitter)
- Fallback mechanisms for failed operations (caching, defaults, etc.)
- Real-time retry monitoring and alerting
- Integration with circuit breaker pattern

### Implementation Details
- Location: `backend/src/middleware/retry.js`
- Service: `backend/src/services/retryService.js`
- Configuration: `backend/src/config/retry.config.js`
- Documentation: `backend/src/docs/retry.doc.js`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **No retry logic**: Rejected because MVP requires production reliability
2. **Basic retry only**: Rejected because intelligent retry requires exponential backoff and configuration
3. **External retry services**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization
