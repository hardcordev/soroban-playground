## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement comprehensive input sanitization and validation for the Soroban Playground backend. This will protect against injection attacks and ensure data integrity.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current backend lacks comprehensive input sanitization, making it vulnerable to injection attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and command injection. Without input sanitization, malicious input could compromise the application or underlying systems. Input sanitization is essential for production-ready security infrastructure.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive input sanitization implementation with:
- Input validation and sanitization middleware
- Context-aware sanitization (SQL, HTML, JSON, etc.)
- Output encoding
- Security policy enforcement
- Integration with existing validation frameworks

### Key Features
- Input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints
- Context-aware sanitization for different input types
- Output encoding for all user-generated content
- Security policy enforcement with configurable rules
- Integration with existing validation frameworks and libraries
- Real-time sanitization monitoring and reporting

### Implementation Details
- Location: `backend/src/middleware/validation.js`
- Service: `backend/src/services/validationService.js`
- Configuration: `backend/src/config/validation.config.js`
- Documentation: `backend/src/docs/validation.doc.js`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **No input sanitization**: Rejected because MVP requires production security
2. **Basic validation only**: Rejected because comprehensive sanitization requires full implementation
3. **External validation services**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization
