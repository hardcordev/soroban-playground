title: "[SMART CONTRACT] Implement Decentralized Oracle Network Contract"
labels: enhancement, smart-contract, high-priority

## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a production-ready decentralized oracle network contract that provides reliable, tamper-resistant data feeds for Soroban applications. This will enable secure price feeds, weather data, sports results, and other external information.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Soroban applications currently rely on centralized or single-source oracles, creating single points of failure and potential manipulation. Without decentralized oracle networks, financial applications like synthetic assets and prediction markets cannot achieve true decentralization and security. A decentralized oracle network is essential for production-ready DeFi infrastructure.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive decentralized oracle network implementation with:
- Standard oracle interface compliance
- Decentralized consensus mechanism (weighted voting, median calculation)
- Comprehensive security features (slashing, reputation system, dispute resolution)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, property-based)
- Documentation and examples

### Key Features
- `submitData()`, `aggregateData()`, `getData()` functions for data management
- `stake()`, `unstake()`, `reportMisbehavior()` for oracle participation
- Event emissions (`DataSubmitted`, `DataAggregated`, `Slashed`)
- Security features: reputation scoring, slashing penalties, dispute resolution

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/oracle-network/`
- Testing: `contracts/oracle-network/src/test.rs` with 100+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/oracle-network/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using existing third-party implementations**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
2. **Centralized oracle only**: Rejected because MVP requires decentralization for security
3. **Frontend-only oracle UI**: Rejected because oracle logic must be on-chain for security
