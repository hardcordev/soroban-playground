## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement comprehensive dark mode support and accessibility improvements across the entire Soroban Playground UI. This will improve usability for developers with different visual preferences and accessibility needs.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current UI lacks dark mode support and has accessibility gaps that make it difficult for some developers to use effectively. Without dark mode, developers working in low-light environments experience eye strain. Without accessibility improvements, developers with visual impairments cannot use the application effectively. These features are essential for inclusive developer experience.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive dark mode and accessibility implementation with:
- System-aware dark/light mode detection
- Manual theme switching
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader optimization
- High contrast mode support

### Key Features
- Automatic theme detection based on system preferences
- Manual theme toggle in settings
- Comprehensive dark mode styling for all UI components
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant color contrast ratios
- Full keyboard navigation support (tab, arrow keys, enter)
- ARIA labels and roles for all interactive elements
- Screen reader optimized content structure

### Implementation Details
- Location: `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` (theme provider)
- Components: `frontend/src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx`, `AccessibilityManager.tsx`
- Styling: `frontend/src/styles/dark-mode.css`, `frontend/src/styles/accessibility.css`
- Integration with existing Next.js app router

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Light mode only**: Rejected because MVP requires inclusive design
2. **Basic dark mode only**: Rejected because comprehensive accessibility requires full implementation
3. **Backend-only theme API**: Rejected because frontend implementation is essential for UX
