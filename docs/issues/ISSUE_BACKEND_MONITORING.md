## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability for the Soroban Playground backend. This will enable proactive issue detection, performance optimization, and operational insights.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current backend lacks comprehensive monitoring and observability capabilities. Without monitoring, developers and operators cannot detect issues proactively, optimize performance, or gain operational insights. Monitoring is essential for production-ready infrastructure.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive monitoring implementation with:
- Metrics collection and visualization
- Distributed tracing and request tracking
- Structured logging and log aggregation
- Alerting and notification system
- Health checks and status endpoints

### Key Features
- `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus metrics collection
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry integration
- Structured JSON logging with Winston
- Alerting system with configurable thresholds
- `/health` endpoint for health checks
- Dashboard integration with Grafana

### Implementation Details
- Location: `backend/src/metrics/`
- Service: `backend/src/services/metricsService.js`
- Configuration: `backend/src/config/metrics.config.js`
- Documentation: `backend/src/docs/metrics.doc.js`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **No monitoring**: Rejected because MVP requires production observability
2. **Basic logging only**: Rejected because comprehensive monitoring requires full implementation
3. **External monitoring services**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization
