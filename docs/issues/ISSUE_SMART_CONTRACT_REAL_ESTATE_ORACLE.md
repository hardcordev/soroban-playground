## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a production-ready real estate oracle contract that provides reliable, tamper-resistant property data for Soroban applications. This will enable secure real estate tokenization, property valuation, and other real estate data-dependent applications.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Applications like real estate tokenization currently lack reliable property data sources. Without real estate oracles, these applications cannot function reliably or securely. Real estate oracles are essential for production-ready real-world asset applications.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive real estate oracle implementation with:
- Standard property data interface compliance
- Multiple data source integration (property databases, appraisal services, title registries)
- Comprehensive security features (data validation, outlier detection, circuit breakers)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, property-based)
- Documentation and examples

### Key Features
- `submitPropertyData()`, `getPropertyData()`, `getValuationData()` functions for property management
- `addDataSource()`, `removeDataSource()`, `setVerificationThreshold()` for source management
- Event emissions (`PropertyDataSubmitted`, `PropertyDataVerified`, `CircuitBreakerActivated`)
- Security features: data validation, outlier detection, circuit breakers

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/real-estate-oracle/`
- Testing: `contracts/real-estate-oracle/src/test.rs` with 70+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/real-estate-oracle/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using existing third-party implementations**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
2. **Single-source property data only**: Rejected because MVP requires reliability for real estate applications
3. **Frontend-only property UI**: Rejected because real estate oracle logic must be on-chain for security
