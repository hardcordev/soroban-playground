about: Implement supply chain oracle contract for reliable logistics data
title: "[SMART CONTRACT] Implement Supply Chain Oracle Contract"
labels: enhancement, smart-contract, high-priority

## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a production-ready supply chain oracle contract that provides reliable, tamper-resistant logistics data for Soroban applications. This will enable secure supply chain tracking, provenance verification, and other logistics data-dependent applications.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Applications like supply chain tracking currently lack reliable logistics data sources. Without supply chain oracles, these applications cannot function reliably or securely. Supply chain oracles are essential for production-ready real-world asset applications.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive supply chain oracle implementation with:
- Standard logistics data interface compliance
- Multiple data source integration (IoT sensors, shipping APIs, customs databases)
- Comprehensive security features (data validation, outlier detection, circuit breakers)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, property-based)
- Documentation and examples

### Key Features
- `submitLogisticsData()`, `getLogisticsData()`, `getProvenanceData()` functions for logistics management
- `addDataSource()`, `removeDataSource()`, `setVerificationThreshold()` for source management
- Event emissions (`LogisticsDataSubmitted`, `LogisticsDataVerified`, `CircuitBreakerActivated`)
- Security features: data validation, outlier detection, circuit breakers

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/supply-chain-oracle/`
- Testing: `contracts/supply-chain-oracle/src/test.rs` with 70+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/supply-chain-oracle/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using existing third-party implementations**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
2. **Single-source logistics data only**: Rejected because MVP requires reliability for supply chain applications
3. **Frontend-only logistics UI**: Rejected because supply chain oracle logic must be on-chain for security
