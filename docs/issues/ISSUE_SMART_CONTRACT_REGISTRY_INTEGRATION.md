## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement contract registry integration that enables Soroban contracts to register themselves with a centralized contract registry. This will provide discoverability and interoperability between contracts.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Soroban contracts currently cannot be discovered or integrated with other contracts automatically. Without contract registry integration, developers must manually configure contract addresses and interfaces, creating maintenance challenges and reducing interoperability. Contract registry integration is essential for production-ready ecosystems.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive contract registry integration with:
- Standard registry interface compliance
- Flexible configuration (registry address, registration permissions, metadata)
- Comprehensive security features (registry validation, metadata verification, revocation)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, property-based)
- Documentation and examples

### Key Features
- `registerWithRegistry()`, `unregisterFromRegistry()`, `getRegistryInfo()` functions for registry management
- `setRegistryMetadata()`, `getRegistryMetadata()` for metadata management
- Event emissions (`Registered`, `Unregistered`, `MetadataUpdated`)
- Security features: registry validation, metadata verification, revocation

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/registry-integration/`
- Testing: `contracts/registry-integration/src/test.rs` with 60+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/registry-integration/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using existing third-party implementations**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
2. **Manual contract address configuration only**: Rejected because MVP requires automated discovery
3. **Frontend-only registry UI**: Rejected because registry integration must be on-chain for security
