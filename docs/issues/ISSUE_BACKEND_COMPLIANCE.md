## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement security compliance reporting and verification for the Soroban Playground backend. This will enable automated compliance checks and reporting for security standards.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current backend lacks automated compliance reporting capabilities, making it difficult to verify compliance with security standards. Without compliance reporting, developers and operators cannot demonstrate adherence to security standards like SOC2, ISO27001, or GDPR. Compliance reporting is essential for production-ready security infrastructure.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive compliance reporting implementation with:
- Automated compliance checks
- Compliance report generation
- Security standard verification
- Integration with audit logging
- Compliance dashboard integration

### Key Features
- Automated compliance checks for security standards (SOC2, ISO27001, GDPR)
- Compliance report generation in multiple formats (PDF, HTML, JSON)
- Security standard verification and scoring
- Integration with audit logging and monitoring
- Compliance dashboard with visual indicators and status tracking
- Configurable compliance policies and thresholds

### Implementation Details
- Location: `backend/src/compliance/`
- Service: `backend/src/services/complianceService.js`
- Configuration: `backend/src/config/compliance.config.js`
- Documentation: `backend/src/docs/compliance.doc.js`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **No compliance reporting**: Rejected because MVP requires production security
2. **Manual compliance checks only**: Rejected because automated reporting requires full implementation
3. **External compliance services**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization
