## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a comprehensive Soroban contract testing framework and utilities that provide reusable, secure patterns for contract testing. These utilities will improve developer productivity and reduce security risks in contract testing.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Developers building Soroban contracts currently need to implement custom test harnesses for each contract. This leads to inconsistent testing practices, increased development time, and potential security gaps. Standardized, audited testing utilities would significantly improve test quality and developer experience.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive set of testing utility contracts including:
- `TestHarness`: Secure wrapper for contract testing with mock environments
- `MockOracle`: Utility for mocking oracle data during testing
- `MockToken`: Utility for mocking token interactions during testing
- `TestAssertions`: Utility for enhanced contract assertions and error reporting
- `FuzzTester`: Utility for property-based fuzz testing of contract functions

### Key Features
- Soroban-optimized testing patterns
- Comprehensive security validation (mock validation, assertion checking)
- Gas-efficient operations
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation and usage examples

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/testing-framework/`
- Testing: `contracts/testing-framework/src/test.rs` with 120+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/testing-framework/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using raw test calls**: Rejected due to security risks and lack of validation
2. **Implementing utilities in each contract separately**: Rejected due to code duplication and inconsistency
3. **Using external libraries**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
