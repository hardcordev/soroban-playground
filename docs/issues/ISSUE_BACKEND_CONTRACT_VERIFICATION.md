## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a contract verification service that enables developers to verify Soroban contract source code against deployed bytecode. This will provide transparency, security, and trust for contract users.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Soroban contracts currently cannot be verified against their source code, creating trust issues and security risks. Without verification, users cannot confirm that deployed contracts match their published source code, making them vulnerable to malicious deployments. Contract verification is essential for production-ready applications.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive contract verification service with:
- Source code submission and storage
- Bytecode verification against source code
- Verification status tracking and display
- Integration with contract registry
- Security validation and integrity checking

### Key Features
- `POST /verify/contracts`: Submit source code for verification
- `GET /verify/contracts/{id}`: Get verification status
- `GET /verify/contracts/{id}/source`: Get verified source code
- `POST /verify/contracts/{id}/reverify`: Re-verify contract
- `GET /verify/contracts/search`: Search verified contracts

### Implementation Details
- Location: `backend/src/routes/verification.js`
- Service: `backend/src/services/verificationService.js`
- Database: PostgreSQL table `contract_verification`
- Documentation: `backend/src/docs/verification.doc.js`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual verification only**: Rejected because MVP requires automated verification
2. **Frontend-only verification UI**: Rejected because backend service is essential for security
3. **External verification services**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization
