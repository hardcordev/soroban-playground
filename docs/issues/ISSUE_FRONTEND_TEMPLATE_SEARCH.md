## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement advanced search and filtering capabilities for the contract template library. This will enable developers to quickly find relevant contract templates based on functionality, category, and technical requirements.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current template browsing requires manual navigation through the directory structure. Without advanced search and filtering, developers waste time searching for templates and may miss relevant examples. Advanced search is essential for improving developer productivity.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive template search and filtering implementation with:
- Full-text search across template names, descriptions, and README content
- Advanced filtering by category, functionality, and technical requirements
- Smart suggestions and autocomplete
- Search history and saved searches
- Performance optimization for large template sets

### Key Features
- Full-text search across all 54+ contract templates
- Filter by category (financial, governance, utility, etc.)
- Filter by functionality (token, voting, oracle, etc.)
- Filter by technical requirements (Rust version, dependencies, etc.)
- Smart suggestions based on search terms
- Search history and saved search filters

### Implementation Details
- Location: `frontend/src/app/template-library/page.tsx`
- Components: `frontend/src/components/TemplateSearchBar.tsx`, `TemplateFilter.tsx`
- Integration with existing contract metadata and README files

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Basic directory navigation only**: Rejected because MVP requires improved developer experience
2. **Simple keyword search only**: Rejected because advanced filtering requires comprehensive implementation
3. **Backend-only search API**: Rejected because frontend UI is essential for developer experience
