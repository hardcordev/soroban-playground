## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement configurable circuit breaker policies and thresholds for all backend API endpoints. This will enable fine-grained control over circuit breaker behavior based on service requirements.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current backend lacks configurable circuit breaker policies, making it difficult to tune circuit breaker behavior for different services and dependencies. Without configurable policies, developers cannot optimize circuit breaker behavior for specific use cases. Configurable policies are essential for production-ready flexibility.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive circuit breaker configuration implementation with:
- Per-dependency circuit breaker configuration
- Configurable failure thresholds and timeouts
- Adaptive circuit breaker policies
- Configuration validation and management
- Integration with existing configuration system

### Key Features
- Per-dependency circuit breaker configuration (database, Redis, Soroban CLI)
- Configurable failure thresholds (failure rate, timeout, request volume)
- Adaptive circuit breaker policies based on service load and performance
- Configuration validation and management interface
- Integration with existing configuration system

### Implementation Details
- Location: `backend/src/config/circuitBreaker.config.js`
- Service: `backend/src/services/circuitBreakerConfigService.js`
- Configuration: `backend/src/config/circuitBreaker.config.js`
- Documentation: `backend/src/docs/circuitBreakerConfig.doc.js`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **No configuration**: Rejected because MVP requires production flexibility
2. **Hardcoded policies only**: Rejected because configurable policies require full implementation
3. **External configuration services**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization
