## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a production-ready pause toggle contract that enables emergency circuit breakers for critical operations. This will provide essential security for stopping malicious or erroneous contract execution during emergencies.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Critical contract functionality currently lacks emergency pause capabilities. Without pause mechanisms, malicious actors who discover vulnerabilities could immediately exploit them, or erroneous code could cause significant damage before fixes can be deployed. Pause toggles provide essential safety mechanisms to stop contract functionality temporarily while issues are addressed.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive pause toggle implementation with:
- Standard pause interface compliance
- Flexible configuration (pause/unpause permissions, pause reasons, audit logging)
- Comprehensive security features (admin-only control, pause state validation, event logging)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, property-based)
- Documentation and examples

### Key Features
- `pause()`, `unpause()`, `isPaused()` functions for operation management
- `getPauseReason()`, `getPauseTimestamp()` for audit information
- Event emissions (`Paused`, `Unpaused`)
- Security features: admin-only control, pause state validation, audit logging

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/pause-toggle/`
- Testing: `contracts/pause-toggle/src/test.rs` with 60+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/pause-toggle/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using existing third-party implementations**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
2. **Minimal implementation without security features**: Rejected because MVP requires production-ready security
3. **Frontend-only pause UI**: Rejected because pause logic must be on-chain for security
