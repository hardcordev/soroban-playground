## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a comprehensive contract storage browser that allows developers to view, search, filter, and visualize contract storage data. This will significantly improve contract debugging and data analysis capabilities.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Developers currently have no way to view or explore contract storage data visually. Without storage browsing, developers must use CLI commands to inspect storage, making debugging difficult and time-consuming. A comprehensive storage browser is essential for improving developer productivity and debugging capabilities.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive contract storage browser UI with:
- Interactive tree-based storage visualization
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Data type detection and formatting
- Export functionality for analysis
- Real-time storage updates

### Key Features
- Tree view showing all storage keys and values with hierarchical structure
- Search by key name, value, data type, or storage pattern
- Filter by data type (string, number, address, bytes, etc.)
- Visual formatting for different data types (hex, base64, JSON, etc.)
- Export to CSV/JSON for external analysis
- Real-time updates when storage changes

### Implementation Details
- Location: `frontend/src/app/storage-browser/page.tsx`
- Components: `frontend/src/components/StorageTree.tsx`, `StorageSearchBar.tsx`, `DataTypeFormatter.tsx`
- Integration with backend storage API routes

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual CLI storage inspection only**: Rejected because MVP requires improved developer experience
2. **Basic storage list only**: Rejected because comprehensive browsing requires rich UI
3. **Backend-only storage API**: Rejected because frontend UI is essential for developer experience
