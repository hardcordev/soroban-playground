about: Implement contract migration utility contracts for Soroban applications
title: "[SMART CONTRACT] Implement Contract Migration Utility Contracts"
labels: enhancement, smart-contract, high-priority
assignees: ''
---

## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a set of contract migration utility contracts that provide reusable, secure patterns for migrating data and state between Soroban contracts. These utilities will improve developer productivity and reduce risks during contract upgrades and migrations.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Developers performing contract migrations currently need to implement custom migration logic for each migration. This leads to inconsistent implementations, increased security risks, and wasted development time. Standardized, audited migration utilities would significantly improve migration quality and developer experience.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive set of migration utility contracts including:
- `MigrationExecutor`: Secure wrapper for executing migration operations with validation
- `StateMigrator`: Utility for transferring state between contracts
- `DataValidator`: Utility for validating migrated data integrity
- `BatchMigrator`: Utility for executing multiple migration operations atomically
- `RollbackHandler`: Utility for handling failed migrations gracefully

### Key Features
- Soroban-optimized migration patterns
- Comprehensive security validation (state validation, integrity checking)
- Gas-efficient operations
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation and usage examples

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/migration-utils/`
- Testing: `contracts/migration-utils/src/test.rs` with 100+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/migration-utils/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using raw migration calls**: Rejected due to security risks and lack of validation
2. **Implementing utilities in each migration separately**: Rejected due to code duplication and inconsistency
3. **Using external libraries**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
