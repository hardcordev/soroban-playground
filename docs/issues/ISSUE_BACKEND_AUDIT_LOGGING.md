## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement comprehensive audit logging and compliance reporting for the Soroban Playground backend. This will enable security monitoring, compliance verification, and forensic analysis.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current backend lacks comprehensive audit logging capabilities, making it difficult to track security-sensitive operations and verify compliance. Without audit logging, developers and operators cannot monitor sensitive operations or demonstrate compliance with security standards. Audit logging is essential for production-ready security infrastructure.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive audit logging implementation with:
- Security-sensitive operation logging
- Immutable audit log storage
- Compliance reporting capabilities
- Log retention and rotation policies
- Integration with security monitoring

### Key Features
- Audit logging for all security-sensitive operations (deploy, invoke, admin actions)
- Immutable audit log storage with tamper-evident properties
- Compliance reporting for security standards (SOC2, ISO27001)
- Configurable log retention and rotation policies
- Integration with security information and event management (SIEM)
- Real-time audit log monitoring and alerting

### Implementation Details
- Location: `backend/src/audit/`
- Service: `backend/src/services/auditService.js`
- Configuration: `backend/src/config/audit.config.js`
- Documentation: `backend/src/docs/audit.doc.js`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **No audit logging**: Rejected because MVP requires production security
2. **Basic logging only**: Rejected because comprehensive audit logging requires full implementation
3. **External audit services**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization
