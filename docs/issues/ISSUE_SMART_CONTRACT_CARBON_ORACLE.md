## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a production-ready carbon credit oracle contract that provides reliable, tamper-resistant carbon credit data for Soroban applications. This will enable secure carbon credit trading, environmental impact tracking, and other sustainability data-dependent applications.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Applications like carbon credit trading currently lack reliable carbon credit data sources. Without carbon credit oracles, these applications cannot function reliably or securely. Carbon credit oracles are essential for production-ready sustainability applications.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive carbon credit oracle implementation with:
- Standard carbon credit data interface compliance
- Multiple data source integration (carbon registries, verification agencies, satellite monitoring)
- Comprehensive security features (data validation, outlier detection, circuit breakers)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, property-based)
- Documentation and examples

### Key Features
- `submitCarbonData()`, `getCarbonData()`, `getVerificationStatus()` functions for carbon management
- `addDataSource()`, `removeDataSource()`, `setVerificationThreshold()` for source management
- Event emissions (`CarbonDataSubmitted`, `CarbonDataVerified`, `CircuitBreakerActivated`)
- Security features: data validation, outlier detection, circuit breakers

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/carbon-oracle/`
- Testing: `contracts/carbon-oracle/src/test.rs` with 70+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/carbon-oracle/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using existing third-party implementations**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
2. **Single-source carbon data only**: Rejected because MVP requires reliability for carbon credit applications
3. **Frontend-only carbon UI**: Rejected because carbon oracle logic must be on-chain for security
