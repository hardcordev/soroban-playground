## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement comprehensive output encoding and security policy enforcement for the Soroban Playground backend. This will protect against XSS and other client-side attacks.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current backend lacks comprehensive output encoding, making it vulnerable to XSS and other client-side attacks. Without output encoding, malicious content could be injected into responses and executed in user browsers. Output encoding is essential for production-ready security infrastructure.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive output encoding implementation with:
- Context-aware output encoding (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, URL, etc.)
- Security policy enforcement middleware
- Automatic encoding for all user-generated content
- Integration with existing templating systems
- Security policy configuration and management

### Key Features
- Context-aware output encoding for different output contexts
- Security policy enforcement middleware for all API endpoints
- Automatic encoding for all user-generated content
- Integration with existing templating systems and frameworks
- Security policy configuration and management interface
- Real-time encoding monitoring and reporting

### Implementation Details
- Location: `backend/src/middleware/encoding.js`
- Service: `backend/src/services/encodingService.js`
- Configuration: `backend/src/config/encoding.config.js`
- Documentation: `backend/src/docs/encoding.doc.js`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **No output encoding**: Rejected because MVP requires production security
2. **Basic encoding only**: Rejected because comprehensive encoding requires full implementation
3. **External encoding services**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization
