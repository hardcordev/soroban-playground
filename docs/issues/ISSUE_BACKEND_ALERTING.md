## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement an alerting and notification system for the Soroban Playground backend. This will enable proactive issue detection, operational notifications, and automated responses to critical events.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current backend lacks alerting capabilities, making it difficult to detect and respond to critical issues proactively. Without alerting, developers and operators cannot be notified of problems in real-time, leading to extended downtime and degraded service quality. Alerting is essential for production-ready operations.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive alerting implementation with:
- Configurable alert thresholds and conditions
- Multiple notification channels (email, Slack, webhooks)
- Alert silencing and escalation policies
- Integration with monitoring and observability
- Alert history and management interface

### Key Features
- Configurable alert rules based on metrics and logs
- Email, Slack, and webhook notification support
- Alert silencing for maintenance windows
- Escalation policies for critical alerts
- Alert history and status tracking
- Integration with Prometheus and Grafana

### Implementation Details
- Location: `backend/src/alerting/`
- Service: `backend/src/services/alertingService.js`
- Configuration: `backend/src/config/alerting.config.js`
- Documentation: `backend/src/docs/alerting.doc.js`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **No alerting**: Rejected because MVP requires proactive issue detection
2. **Basic email alerts only**: Rejected because comprehensive alerting requires full implementation
3. **External alerting services**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization
