## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement comprehensive filtering capabilities for the contract template library. This will enable developers to quickly narrow down contract templates based on multiple criteria simultaneously.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current template browsing requires manual navigation through the directory structure. Without comprehensive filtering, developers waste time searching for templates and may miss relevant examples. Comprehensive filtering is essential for improving developer productivity.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive template filtering implementation with:
- Multi-criteria filtering (category, functionality, dependencies, etc.)
- Advanced filter combinations and saved filter presets
- Filter suggestions and auto-complete
- Performance optimization for large template sets
- Visual filter indicators and reset functionality

### Key Features
- Filter by category (financial, governance, utility, etc.)
- Filter by functionality (token, voting, oracle, etc.)
- Filter by technical requirements (Rust version, dependencies, etc.)
- Filter by complexity level (simple, intermediate, advanced)
- Filter by deployment status (ready, beta, experimental)
- Saved filter presets for common use cases

### Implementation Details
- Location: `frontend/src/app/template-library/page.tsx`
- Components: `frontend/src/components/TemplateFilter.tsx`, `FilterPresetManager.tsx`
- Integration with existing contract metadata and README files

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Basic directory navigation only**: Rejected because MVP requires improved developer experience
2. **Simple single-filter only**: Rejected because comprehensive filtering requires multi-criteria support
3. **Backend-only filtering API**: Rejected because frontend UI is essential for developer experience
