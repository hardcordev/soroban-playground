## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement comprehensive keyboard navigation and shortcut support across the entire Soroban Playground UI. This will improve usability for developers who prefer keyboard-first workflows and those with motor impairments.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

The current UI lacks comprehensive keyboard navigation support, making it difficult for developers to use without a mouse. Without keyboard navigation, developers with motor impairments cannot use the application effectively, and keyboard-first developers experience reduced productivity. Keyboard navigation is essential for inclusive developer experience.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive keyboard navigation implementation with:
- Full keyboard navigation support (tab, arrow keys, enter, escape)
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts
- Focus management and visual indicators
- Screen reader optimization
- Context-aware shortcuts

### Key Features
- Tab-based navigation through all interactive elements
- Arrow key navigation in lists and grids
- Enter/Space activation of buttons and controls
- Escape key dismissal of modals and dropdowns
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+P for deploy, etc.)
- Visual focus indicators for all interactive elements

### Implementation Details
- Location: `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` (keyboard provider)
- Components: `frontend/src/components/KeyboardManager.tsx`, `ShortcutManager.tsx`
- Integration with existing Next.js app router and Monaco editor

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Mouse-only navigation**: Rejected because MVP requires inclusive design
2. **Basic keyboard support only**: Rejected because comprehensive navigation requires full implementation
3. **Backend-only keyboard API**: Rejected because frontend implementation is essential for UX
