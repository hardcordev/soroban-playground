## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a production-ready weather data oracle contract that provides reliable, tamper-resistant weather data for Soroban applications. This will enable secure weather derivatives, insurance protocols, and other environmental data-dependent applications.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Applications like insurance protocols and weather derivatives currently lack reliable weather data sources. Without weather oracles, these applications cannot function reliably or securely. Weather oracles are essential for production-ready real-world asset applications.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive weather data oracle implementation with:
- Standard weather data interface compliance
- Multiple data source integration (satellite, ground stations, weather APIs)
- Comprehensive security features (data validation, outlier detection, circuit breakers)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, property-based)
- Documentation and examples

### Key Features
- `submitWeatherData()`, `getWeatherData()`, `getHistoricalData()` functions for weather management
- `addDataSource()`, `removeDataSource()`, `setVerificationThreshold()` for source management
- Event emissions (`WeatherDataSubmitted`, `WeatherDataVerified`, `CircuitBreakerActivated`)
- Security features: data validation, outlier detection, circuit breakers

### Implementation Details
- Location: `contracts/weather-data-oracle/`
- Testing: `contracts/weather-data-oracle/src/test.rs` with 70+ test cases
- Documentation: `contracts/weather-data-oracle/README.md`

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Using existing third-party implementations**: Rejected due to lack of Soroban-specific optimization and audit history
2. **Single-source weather data only**: Rejected because MVP requires reliability for insurance applications
3. **Frontend-only weather UI**: Rejected because weather oracle logic must be on-chain for security
