## 📝 Feature Summary

Implement a comprehensive contract deployment wizard that guides developers through the contract deployment process with intelligent parameter configuration, network selection, and gas estimation. This will significantly improve the deployment experience and reduce errors.

## ❓ Problem or Motivation

Developers currently need to manually configure deployment parameters and execute complex CLI commands. Without a deployment wizard, developers make configuration errors, select incorrect networks, and waste time on deployment failures. A comprehensive deployment wizard is essential for improving developer experience and reducing deployment errors.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive contract deployment wizard with:
- Multi-step guided workflow
- Intelligent parameter configuration based on contract type
- Network selection with testnet configuration
- Real-time gas estimation and cost calculation
- Validation and error prevention
- Deployment history and status tracking

### Key Features
- Step-by-step wizard interface (select contract → configure parameters → select network → review → deploy)
- Smart parameter forms with validation and examples
- Network selector with Stellar Testnet, Futurenet, and custom RPC
- Real-time gas estimation showing estimated cost in XLM
- Deployment status tracking with progress indicators
- Deployment history with success/failure status

### Implementation Details
- Location: `frontend/src/app/deploy-wizard/page.tsx`
- Components: `frontend/src/components/DeploymentWizard.tsx`, `ParameterForm.tsx`, `NetworkSelector.tsx`
- Integration with backend deployment API routes

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual CLI deployment only**: Rejected because MVP requires improved developer experience
2. **Basic deployment form only**: Rejected because comprehensive wizard requires multi-step guidance
3. **Backend-only deployment API**: Rejected because frontend UI is essential for developer experience
